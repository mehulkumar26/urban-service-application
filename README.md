# Urban Service Application 

## Introduction
Designed an android application which provides daily life urban services to the users like house help, plumber, haircut etc. The interface of the application is designed using recycler view.

## Methodology

### Constraint Layout
 It simplifies creating complex layouts in Android by making it possible to build most of your UI using only the visual editor in Android Studio. It allows you to  connect all the view components to each other and place them on screen.
 
### Event Listener
An event listener is an interface in the View class that contains a single callback method. These methods will be called by the Android framework when the View to which the listener has been registered is triggered by user interaction with the item in the UI. 

### Recycler View 
Recycler View has a more extensible framework, especially since it provides the ability to implement both horizontal and vertical layouts. Recycler View widget is used when you have data collections whose elements change at runtime based on user action or network events.

### Fragments
A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input events. Fragments cannot live on their own--they must be hosted by an activity or another fragment. Fragments introduce modularity and reusability into the activityâ€™s UI by dividing the UI into discrete chunks.
